Getting started on things

I'm an active duty Marine working on my Computer Science degree.  I have done introductory courses all over the place, getting my feet wet in programming, webdev, data engineering, data science.  I retire from the Marine Corps in 8 years and hope by then I'll have put together the skills to succeed in one of these areas.
